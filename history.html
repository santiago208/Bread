                            The beginnings were difficult. In 1947 the town of La Julia, Huila was still half done. The
                            population was around one thousand inhabitants. Valentina and Nelson Muñoz ventured into a
                            business that years later has paid off: The Bakery Tricks bread.

                            The promoter of this company, Nelson, kneaded the bread at the end of the 40s in his house
                            located in the street of "La Julia". Previously, he acquired some lebrillos and aprons,
                            carried out some works in his workshop-home and agreed with a baker already seated the
                            rental of the oven. He went to the fountain in the square for water and once he had the
                            bread ready for cooking he took it to the oven of a local bakery (Fernando's)

                            There is hardly any testimony of the wood-burning furnaces and furnaces, except in the
                            memory of the founder of our company, Nelson Muños, known as "The Baker". The business he
                            started in 1947, with great effort, has consolidated and thrives firmly. His only son, heir
                            of the family business, face the future with the latest technological advances and
                            facilities. Parallel to the growth of the town and the influx of tourists, demand increased
                            and with it, the production process was mechanized. The heirs remember their first steps in
                            the company they currently manage.
